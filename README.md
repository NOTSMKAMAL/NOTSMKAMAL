## About Me 

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at UC Riverside with experience in web development, Java application development, program testing, database management, and data structures and algorithms. Through hands-on project work and campus involvement, I’ve built strong problem-solving skills, learned to design efficient algorithms, and enjoy implementing interactive, data-driven applications. My goal is to apply these skills to impactful projects while continuing to grow professionally as a developer.
